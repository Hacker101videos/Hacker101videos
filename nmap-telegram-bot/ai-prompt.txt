Create a Node.js Telegram bot that performs the following nmap scans:

Step 1. Create a menu with these scan options with descriptions of each scan option.

Network Discovery Scan: Discovers live hosts on the network.
TCP Connect Scan: Performs a TCP connect scan on the target.
TCP SYN/Stealth Scan: Executes a stealthy TCP SYN scan.
UDP Scan: Conducts a UDP port scan on the target.
OS Detection: Attempts to determine the target's operating system.
Version Detection: Tries to identify versions of services running on target ports.
Vulnerability Detection: Detects vulnerabilities using Nmap scripts.
Specific Port Scan: Scans a specific port on the target IP.
Aggressive Scan: Performs an aggressive scan with more information.
Intense Scan: A more intensive scan that includes all available scan types.

Step 2. Ask the user which NMAP scan they would like to perform from the scan menu.

Step3. Once the user selects the scan type then ask the user for the IP or target address to scan with nmap

Step 4. If Specific port scan option is selected then ask the user for the IP and Port or target and Port address to scan with nmap

Step 5. Scan the IP or target entered by the user using the nmap and scan type command

Step 6. Display the results of the scan back to Telegram bot
