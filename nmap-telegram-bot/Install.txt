Introducing the Hacker101 Telegram Nmap Scan Bot designed for Nmap scans. This bot was written 100% with ChatGPT in less than 1 hour utilizing the Node.js framework.

TCP SYN/Stealth Scan: Executes a stealthy TCP SYN scan.
UDP Scan: Conducts a UDP port scan on the target.
OS Detection: Attempts to determine the target's operating system.
Version Detection: Tries to identify versions of services running on target ports.
Vulnerability Detection: Detects vulnerabilities using Nmap scripts.
Specific Port Scan: Scans a specific port on the target IP.
Aggressive Scan: Performs an aggressive scan with more information.

These scan types enable users to gather comprehensive information about network hosts and services, aiding in security assessment and network management.
